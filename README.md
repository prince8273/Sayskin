# A Recommendation System for Facial Skin Care

This project presents a simple recommendation system designed to help users choose facial skincare products based on their preferences and concerns. It uses user input‚Äîsuch as skin tone, type, and acne level‚Äîto display relevant recommendations from a curated product database.

The application is built as a **web app**, combining a Python backend (Flask) and a React-based frontend. The goal is to provide users with a lightweight, accessible tool for skincare product suggestions without relying on machine learning models.

## üß± System Architecture

The application consists of:
- A **frontend** interface where users can capture or upload facial images and input preferences.
- A **backend** server that processes user inputs and returns product recommendations based on pre-defined rules or similarity matching techniques.
- A **product dataset** which stores information about available skincare items.

This modular architecture ensures the system can be maintained and scaled easily.
